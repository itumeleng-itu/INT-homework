## ðŸ“¢ Deployment Notice


Due to security constraints within the application (e.g., backend dependencies, session management, etc.), we were **unable to deploy it using GitHub Pages**, which only supports static front-end content.

However, the application is **fully functional** and has been thoroughly tested in a local environment using **NetBeans**.

### ðŸš€ Demonstration
We are fully prepared to present a **live demo** of the application running in NetBeans at your convenience.



### Project Files
The project files are in the master branch
